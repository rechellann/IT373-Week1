# Reflection - IT373 Week 1 Django Setup

This week’s Django setup was a good learning experience. Some steps went fine, but I also encounter problems. At first, I used the wrong command to activate the virtual environment, so Django didn’t install properly. I checked my notes and fixed it by using `source .venv/bin/activate`.

I also ran into trouble at some other parts. Also I forgot to activate the virtual environment before running the command. I encountered problems and prompt wrong commands so I got lost on the process.

Starting the server was easy, and seeing the Django welcome page made me feel proud. I wasn’t sure about the dot in `startproject config .`, but I searched online and found out it keeps the files in the current folder, which is what I needed.

Setting up Git and pushing to GitHub was okay. I just made sure the remote URL was correct before pushing. Overall, I learned to be careful with commands and to check things when something doesn’t work. It was a good start to working with Django.
